# wesbarnett/apache-flask

A base Docker container for running Python3 Flask/Apache applications
with an Ubuntu userland.

See [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/wesbarnett/apache-flask/blob/master/README.md)
for a list of changes.

## Usage

This image is used as a base for Python3 Flask applications via
Apache's Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI). All you need to do is
create a Dockerfile and use `FROM` to set this as the base image.

The following images are available:

* `wesbarnett/apache-flask:bionic-x86_64`

From there you Dockerfile should copy your Apache configuration files
and your Flask project and then enable your Apache configuration
files.  Alternatively mount the project and configuration files with
the `-v` flag when you use `docker run`. 

Place `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your Dockerfile for
additional Python package requirements. You need at least the `flask`
and `mod-wsgi` packages. The image then automatically installs from
those requirements. 

## Example

A minimal working example is in the `example` folder. I recommend
using this as a template to build your Docker Flask project.

Additionally, an example of a project using this image is
