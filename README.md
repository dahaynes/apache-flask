# apache-flask

A base Docker container for running Python3 Flask/Apache applications
with an Ubuntu userland.

## Usage

This image is used as a base for Python3 Flask applications via
Apache's Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI). All you need to do is
create a Dockerfile that copies your Apache configuration files and
your Flask project and then enable your Apache configuration files.
Alternatively mount the project and configuration files with the `-v`
flag when you use `docker run`. 

Place `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your Dockerfile for
additional requirements. The image then automatically installs from
those requirements. `flask`, `flask-wtf`, and `mod-wsgi`
are all preinstalled in this image, along with their requirements.

A minimal example is in the `example` folder.

Another example using SSL is here:

* [Example Dockerfile](https://github.com/wesbarnett/movie-ratings/blob/master/Dockerfile)
* [Example Apache configs](https://github.com/wesbarnett/movie-ratings/tree/master/apache)

The Docker repository is located
[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wesbarnett/apache-flask/).

When you run your image with `docker run` it will execute `apache2ctl
-D FOREGROUND`. Ports `80` and `443` are exposed, and Apache module
`ssl` is enabled by default.
